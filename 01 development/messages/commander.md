# Chief commander log

Append-only. Format: `[ISO timestamp] TYPE: message` (see `messages/README.md`).

Commander uses these types:
- `WAKEUP` — start of a wake cycle
- `READ` — read terminal logs (summary of what's new)
- `REPLY` — reply to a Q-ASSUMED or Q-BLOCKED (reference question's timestamp)
- `PLAN` — a planning decision (next round, priority shift)
- `SLEEP` — scheduling next wakeup with delay + reason

[2026-05-03T23:47:32Z] WAKEUP: cycle 1 — pre-launch. T1/T2/T3 logs empty. Ed about to paste prompts into 3 fresh Claude auto-mode terminals. Nothing to process this cycle.
[2026-05-03T23:47:32Z] SLEEP: 1500s (25 min). Mid-cadence to catch first STARTED entries when terminals come online.

[2026-05-04T07:00:00Z] WAKEUP: cycle 2 — manual (loop died after cycle 1; resumed by Ed for handoff to web). T1 + T2 + T3 have been working autonomously in parallel. Commits since cycle 1: T1 bootstrap + server modules (commit 19f0613), T2 server domain (commit 1321fb5). T3 STARTED with package scaffold + types (uncommitted in working tree). Open Q-ASSUMED items: 4 — addressed via per-terminal from-orchestrator.md replies in this cycle.
[2026-05-04T07:00:00Z] PLAN: Round 1 in progress. T1 ~50% (bootstrap done, server modules done; auth + middleware + chrome + pages remaining). T2 ~70% (server domain landed; API + admin pages + manifest remaining). T3 ~15% (package + types scaffolded; editor + blocks + portal-variants port remaining). One real cross-team issue: T2's `PortalVariantPort.role` is typed as user-Role, should be `PortalRole`. Correction sent to T2 inbox; T3 already shipping the right type.
[2026-05-04T07:00:00Z] SLEEP: deferred — Ed switching to Claude web. Commander loop is offline until Ed re-engages it from a Mac terminal OR converts it to a cloud `/schedule` agent.
