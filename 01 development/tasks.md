# Tasks

## In progress
_(T1 R2 done — see `Done — Round 2` below)_

## Done — Round 1
- [x] **T1 — Foundation** — shipped. `04 the final portal/portal/` scaffolded
      on Next 16 + React 19 + Tailwind 4. Plugin runtime, three-level
      tenancy (Agency/Client/EndCustomer), HMAC cookie auth with role +
      tenant-scope gating, server-rendered chrome with brand-kit injector,
      file-backed storage abstraction. Working `/`, `/login`, `/embed/login`,
      `/portal/agency` after first-run bootstrap. `npm run build` and
      `npx tsc --noEmit` both clean. See
      `context/prior research/04-foundation.md`.
- [x] **T2 — Fulfillment plugin** — shipped. See `context/prior research/04-plugin-fulfillment.md`. tsc-clean standalone. Pending: foundation wires `PluginRuntimePort` + `PluginRegistryPort` (T1) and brokers `applyStarterVariant` adapter (T3 stubbed body, signature locked).
- [x] **T3 — Website-editor port** — shipped. `@aqua/plugin-website-editor`
      at `04 the final portal/plugins/website-editor/`. Manifest (8 navItems /
      11 pages / 41 api / 58 storefront.blocks / 8 features), full server
      runtime (pages.ts variant helpers + themes/content/sites/embeds/
      preview/discovery), `applyStarterVariant({agencyId, clientId, role:
      PortalRole, variantId, actor?}, storage)` for T2, 6 starter JSON
      trees, storage-keys namespacing under `t/{agencyId}/{clientId}/...`,
      smoke 31/31 pass, tsc clean. Block component UIs and admin page UIs
      ship as Round-1 structural placeholders for Round-2 lift. See
      `context/prior research/04-plugin-website-editor.md`. Pending T2
      one-line refactor: swap `PortalVariantPort.role: Role` →
      `role: PortalRole` (commander confirmed correction).

## Deferred
- [ ] NotebookLM setup — skipped for now. Revisit when we need outside research.

## Done — Round 2
- [x] **T1 R2 — wire fulfillment + demo seed** — shipped.
      `@aqua/plugin-fulfillment` mounted as `file:..` workspace dep
      (Turbopack + `install-links=true` + `transpilePackages`). Foundation
      port adapters bridge T2's ports → T1 server modules. Catch-all
      routes resolve `/portal/agency/[...rest]`,
      `/portal/clients/[clientId]/[...rest]`,
      `/api/portal/[plugin]/[...rest]` to plugin pages + handlers.
      Agency creation auto-installs core plugins (fulfillment seeds 6
      phase defaults via `onInstall`). `/api/dev/seed-demo` provisions
      Demo · Aqua + Felicia mirror at onboarding stage with half-ticked
      checklist. Smoke pass end-to-end. See
      `context/prior research/04-foundation-round2.md`.
- [x] **T2 R2 — ecommerce plugin** — shipped.
      `@aqua/plugin-ecommerce` at `04 the final portal/plugins/ecommerce/`.
      `scopePolicy: "client"`, `requires: ["website-editor"]`. Server
      domain (orders, products, gift cards, referrals, discounts, billing
      vestigial) backed by per-install storage. 23 API routes including
      Stripe webhook (idempotent) + checkout + billing-portal — keys read
      from per-install config, NOT env. 13 admin pages, 7 storefront UI
      components, CartContext with API-driven inventory reservations.
      8 block ids contributed (rendering delegated to T3). tsc-clean
      standalone. See `context/prior research/04-plugin-ecommerce.md`.
      Foundation pending: `registerEcommerceFoundation` call site + T3
      block-renderer registration.

## Done — Round 3
- [x] **T1 R3 — three plugins live** — shipped. `@aqua/plugin-ecommerce`
      and `@aqua/plugin-website-editor` mounted as workspace deps
      alongside fulfillment. `_routeResolver.ts` handles two manifest
      path conventions side-by-side (relative `:name` and full-URL
      `[name]`). API path leading-slash normalised. Real
      `portalVariantAdapter` calls T3's `applyStarterVariant` bound to
      the website-editor install's plugin storage.
      `ecommerceFoundation.ts` side-effect-import registers
      `EcommerceFoundation` at boot. Cross-team patch added re-exports
      to `plugins/ecommerce/src/server/index.ts`. `ActivityCategory`
      extended with `"ecommerce"`. Demo seed installs both client-scoped
      plugins on Felicia. Smoke green: 14 pages 200 + multi-plugin API
      dispatch. See `context/prior research/04-foundation-round3.md`.

## Up next (after Round 3)
- [ ] T3 R2: lift website-editor block UIs + admin UIs from `02` (the
      pages render but most are placeholder shells).
- [ ] T2 follow-up: real Stripe webhook smoke (foundation already routes
      `/api/portal/ecommerce/stripe/webhook` correctly).
- [ ] Build the first phase-preset end-to-end (create client → pick
      Onboarding → fulfillment installs starter plugins → checklist appears
      → both sides tick → advance phase). Foundation runs the preset
      machinery; T2 owns preset definitions.
- [ ] Demo button on milesymedia.com — wraps `/api/dev/seed-demo` with a
      POV toggle.

## Done
- [x] Phase 0 — Prior research. 18 chapters in
      `01 development/context/prior research/`. Indexed in `MASTER.md`.
- [x] Architecture lock-in. `04-architecture.md` chapter covers:
      pool-model multi-tenancy, Aqua-manifest plugins, server-rendered
      chrome, single-cookie auth, phase lifecycle, brand kit per client.
      14 decisions logged.
- [x] Round 1 terminal prompts drafted (T1 / T2 / T3).
- [x] Vercel pinned to deploy only `04 the final portal/milesymedia website/`.
- [x] `eds requirments.md` populated. Drafted by Claude from conversation;
      Ed amends as needed.
